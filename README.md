###  Overview
This is a **Console Application** developed in **C#** to manage student records. The system applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and uses **XML** for data persistence (Saving/Loading data).

The project demonstrates a clean separation of concerns with modular architecture, separating the Data Model, Business Logic, and UI (Console View).

###  Key Features
* **CRUD Operations:** Add, Edit, Delete student profiles efficiently.
* ** Search:** Find students by Name or ID.
* ** Sorting:** Algorithms to sort students by Name (A-Z) or GPA (High-Low).
* ** Data Persistence:** Automatically saves and loads data from `data.xml`.
* ** Formatted Output:** Custom-built table view logic to display data neatly in the console.

###  Technical Highlights
* **Language:** C# (.NET Framework/.NET Core).
* **Architecture:** Modular design:
    * `SinhVien.cs`: Data Model.
    * `QuanLySinhVien.cs`: Business Logic & XML handling.
    * `HienThi.cs`: UI rendering logic.
* **Techniques:** List Manipulation, Exception Handling, File I/O, UTF-8 Encoding support.
